# vue-shop

## Overview
Vue Shop was created as a fake landing page with the purpose of honing my Vue.js knowledge and showcasing some of my abilities as a Front End Developer. The page fetches product data from a Fake Store API endpoint, and comes with the following features:
- Filter by category
- Sort by lowest/highest price
- Add/remove from cart
- Store cart data in local storage for your next session
